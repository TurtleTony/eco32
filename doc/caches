The simulator now contains a first version of separate instruction
and data caches. Their total sizes and line sizes are configurable
from the simulator's command line, but they are only direct-mapped
for now.

The CPU got an instruction which deals with cache management,
"cctl <m>". The immediate value m is a bit mask, where the three
least significant bits have the following meaning:

    2    if set: the icache is invalidated
    1    if set: the dcache performs the action specified by bit 0
    0    if cleared: invalidate cache, if set: flush cache
         this bit is ignored if bit 1 is cleared

Note 1: Synchronizing instruction and data caches can thus be
accomplished by "cctl 7".

Note 2: A good test on software for being cache compliant is
to choose huge cache sizes, in the order of the main memory size.
