This is a test for the instruction cache, intended
to be executed on the simulator only. A direct-mapped
4 KB cache with a line size of 16 bytes should exhibit
440 read misses. If the cache is two-way associative,
with the same total size and line size as above, the
read miss count should drop to 20.

Here is a table which shows the dynamic behavior of
the program running with the two types of caches:

part1:   226 instrs,   4 /  4 read misses
part2:   226 instrs,   4 /  4 read misses
part3:   322 instrs, 256 /  4 read misses
part4:   234 instrs, 176 /  8 read misses
-----------------------------------------
all:    1008 instrs, 440 / 20 read misses
