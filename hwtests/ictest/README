This is a test for the instruction cache, intended
to be executed on the simulator only. A direct-mapped
4 KB cache with a line size of 16 bytes should exhibit
264 read misses. If the cache is two-way associative,
with the same total size and line size as above, the
read miss count should drop to 12.
