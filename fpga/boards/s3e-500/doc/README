Notes
-----

1. Installing JTAG cable drivers under Ubuntu:
   a) When installing ISE, do NOT install any cable drivers.
   b) sudo apt-get install \
        gitk git-gui libusb-dev build-essential libc6-dev fxload
   c) git clone git://git.zerfleddert.de/usb-driver
   d) cd usb-driver
   e) make
   f) ./setup_pcusb /opt/Xilinx/14.5/ISE_DS/ISE/

2. The configuration bitstring for the FPGA is stored in the
   "Platform Flash PROM" (XCF04S). The board must therefore
   be jumpered for "Master Serial Mode" (all 3 jumpers set).

3. Here is the command which burns the configuration bitstring
   into the Platform Flash PROM:
      /opt/Xilinx/14.5/ISE_DS/ISE/bin/lin/impact -batch ./prog.cmd

4. The machine monitor is stored in the "StrataFlash Parallel NOR
   Flash PROM", starting at address 0x000000. The ECO32 CPU can
   access the machine monitor at virtual address 0xE0000000. The
   monitor's size must not exceed 16 MB (the size of the Flash ROM).
