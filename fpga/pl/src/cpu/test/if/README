1. What does it do?
-------------------

This circuit tests the IF pipeline stage. An address generator
(if1a/if1b) generates a sequence of virtual addresses which
are translated to physical addresses (if2), which in turn are
used to access main memory (using the icache, if3). The addresses
are located in ROM, which must be filled with a given random
pattern. It computes a CRC fingerprint from the values read, and
verifies the fingerprint at two points in the address sequence.


2. How do I use it?
-------------------

a) Load the FPGA with the Flash-ROM programmer and program the
   Flash-ROM with the file "eco32/build/simtest/romrand.bin".

b) Load the FPGA with "eco32.bit".

c) Press and release the reset button (the rightmost pushbutton).
   After a fraction of a second, the green LEDG7 should light up,
   and the digits "02" should appear on the leftmost 7-segment
   display.
