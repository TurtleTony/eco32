Intended Use
------------

This memory controller is to be used on a real FPGA. It runs
itself at 100 MHz, as does the SDRAM. The circuit which uses
the controller is expected to run at this clock rate too.


Front-End (interface to caches)
-------------------------------

instruction read:
2^25 * 128 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake

data read/write:
2^25 * 128 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake


Back-End (interface to RAM)
---------------------------

2^25 * 16 bit * 2 = 128 MB
standard SDRAM interface
