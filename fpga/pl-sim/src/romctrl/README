Intended Use
------------

This memory controller offers a complete simulation of the ROM
subsystem, if the given (simplistic) ROM implementation is used.


Front-End (interface to caches)
-------------------------------

instruction read:
2^24 * 128 bit = 256 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake

data read:
2^24 * 128 bit = 256 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake


Back-End (interface to ROM)
---------------------------

2^23 * 8 bit = 8 MB
strobe/acknowledge handshake


ROM
---

The ROM has got an adjustable access time for read operations
(minimum is two clock cycles).
