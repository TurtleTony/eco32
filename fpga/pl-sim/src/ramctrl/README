Intended Use
------------

This memory controller offers a complete simulation of the RAM
subsystem, if the given (simplistic) RAM implementation is used.


Front-End (interface to caches)
-------------------------------

instruction read:
2^25 * 128 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake

data read/write:
2^25 * 128 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake


Back-End (interface to RAM)
---------------------------

2^25 * 16 bit * 2 = 128 MB
strobe/acknowledge handshake


RAM
---

The RAM has got separately adjustable access times for read and
write operations (minimum is two clock cycles each).
