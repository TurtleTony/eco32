In order to determine the correct phase shift for the SDRAM clock,
I synthesized the test circuit with different phase shift settings
and observed its behavior (10 times for every setting). The first
thing I noted: either the test succeeded or it failed every time
I tried. So it seems that the phase shift never assumed the value
that would be necessary to let clock and data edges coincide.

First, I did a coarse measurement in steps of 45 degrees (which
at the given clock rate of 100 MHz equals 10 ns / 8 = 1250 ps):

 delta phi (ps)      result
----------------------------
       0             ok
    1250             ok
    2500             failed
    3750             failed
    5000             ok
    6250             ok
    7500             ok
    8750             ok

Next, I tried to narrow down the boundaries between success
and failure:

1250:  ok
1450:  failed
4400:  failed
4500:  ok

Even more precise measurements could not be performed due to
the finite resolution of the phase shift control of the PLL.

Conclusion: The "forbidden range" for the phase shift is
1350 ps through 4450 ps, with a mean value of 2900 ps.
Therefore the recommended phase shift is 10000 ps - 2900 ps,
which is 7100 ps.
