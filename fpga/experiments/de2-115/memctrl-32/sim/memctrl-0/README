Structure
---------

A top-level module (memtest.v) creates instances of a memory
test circuit (ramtest/ramtest.v) and a memory controller
(ramctrl/ramctrl.v), which in turn builds an internal model
of the external RAM (ramctrl/ram.v).


Intended Use
------------

The memory controller offers a complete simulation of the memory
subsystem, if the given (simplistic) RAM implementation is used.


Front-End (interface to caches)
-------------------------------

data read/write:
2^27 * 32 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake


Back-End (interface to RAM)
---------------------------

2 * 2^25 * 16 bit = 128 MB
strobe/acknowledge handshake


RAM
---

The RAM has got separately adjustable access times for read and
write operations (minimum is two clock cycles each).
