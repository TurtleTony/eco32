In order to determine the correct phase shift for the SDRAM clock,
I synthesized the test circuit with different phase shift settings
and observed its behavior (10 times for every setting). The first
thing I noted: either the test succeeded or it failed every time
I tried. So it seems that the phase shift never assumed the value
that would be necessary to let clock and data edges coincide.

I did a coarse measurement in steps of 45 degrees (which at the
given clock rate of 100 MHz equals 10 ns / 8 = 1250 ps):

 delta phi (ps)      result
----------------------------
       0             ok
    1250             failed
    2500             failed
    3750             failed
    5000             failed
    6250             ok
    7500             ok
    8750             ok

Conclusion: The "forbidden range" for the phase shift is
1250 ps through 5000 ps, with a mean value of about 3100 ps.
Therefore the recommended phase shift is 3100 ps + 10000/2 ps,
which is 8100 ps.
