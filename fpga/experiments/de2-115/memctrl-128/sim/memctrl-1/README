Structure
---------

A top-level module (memtest.v) creates instances of a memory
test circuit (ramtest/ramtest.v) and a memory controller
(ramctrl/ramctrl.v), which in turn builds an internal model of
the external SDRAM (ramctrl/sdr.v, ramctrl/sdr_parameters.vh).


Intended Use
------------

The memory controller offers a complete simulation of the memory
subsystem, including a simulation model of a 512 Mbit SDRAM chip
(provided by Micron Technology). The controller can also be
synthesized for use on a real FPGA (but the PLL for clock phase
shifting required in this case is not included here).


Front-End (interface to caches)
-------------------------------

instruction read:
2^25 * 128 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake

data read/write:
2^25 * 128 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake


Back-End (interface to SDRAMs)
------------------------------

This is the standard SDRAM interface for 512 Mbit devices,
organized as 32 M x 16 bit (in 4 banks, 8192 rows each).
4 banks * 8192 rows * 1024 columns * 16 bit = 512 Mbit = 64 MB
The data pins of two of these memory chips are concatenated
to provide a total memory of 32 M x 32 bit = 128 MB.
