Structure
---------

A top-level module (memtest.v) creates instances of a memory
test circuit (ramtest/ramtest.v) and a memory controller
(ramctrl/ramctrl.v), which in turn builds an internal model
of the external SDRAM (ramctrl/k4s561632e.v).


Intended Use
------------

The memory controller offers a complete simulation of the memory
subsystem, including a simulation model of a 256 Mbit SDRAM chip
(provided by Samsung Electronics). The controller can also be
synthesized for use on a real FPGA (but the DLL for clock phase
shifting required in this case is not included here).


Front-End (interface to caches)
-------------------------------

instruction read:
2^26 * 64 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake

data read/write:
2^26 * 64 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake


Back-End (interface to SDRAM)
-----------------------------

This is the standard SDRAM interface for 256 Mbit devices,
organized as 16 M x 16 bit (in 4 banks, 8192 rows each).
4 banks * 8192 rows * 512 columns * 16 bit = 256 Mbit = 32 MB
