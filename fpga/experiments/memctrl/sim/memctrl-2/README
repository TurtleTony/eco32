Structure
---------

A top-level module (memtest.v) creates instances of a memory
test circuit (ramtest/ramtest.v) and a memory controller
(ramctrl/ramctrl.v), which in turn builds an internal model
of the external SDRAM (ramctrl/k4s561632e.v).


Intended Use
------------

The memory controller offers a complete simulation of the memory
subsystem, including a simulation model of a 256 Mbit SDRAM chip
(provided by Samsung Electronics). The controller can also be
synthesized for use on a real FPGA (but the DLL for clock phase
shifting required in this case is not included here).


Front-End (interface to caches)
-------------------------------

instruction read:
2^26 * 64 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake

data read/write:
2^26 * 64 bit = 512 MB
strobe/acknowledge/timeout handshake


Back-End (interface to SDRAM)
-----------------------------

This is the standard SDRAM interface for 256 Mbit devices,
organized as 16 M x 16 bit (in 4 banks, 8192 rows each).
4 banks * 8192 rows * 512 columns * 16 bit = 256 Mbit = 32 MB


Clocks
------

The SDRAM controller (and the SDRAM itself) is clocked with
100 MHz, the rest of the circuit is clocked with 50 MHz. The
clocks are synchronized, so that every other positive clock
edge at 100 MHz coincides with a positive clock edge at 50 MHz.
Therefore we don't need complicated circuits (FIFO, etc.) to
safely cross the clock domain border; simply stretching both
acknowledge signals to two 100 MHz clock cycles will do.
