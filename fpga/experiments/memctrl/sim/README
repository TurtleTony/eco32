Here are three implementations of a memory controller, all
three intended to be used in simulations. memctrl-0 provides
a very simple underlying RAM model (word access, constant
access delays for read and write). memctrl-1 utilizes a more
realistic SDRAM model (provided by Samsung Electronics).
memctrl-2 is very similar to memctrl-1, but clocks the test
circuit with half the frequency (50 MHz) of the SDRAM's
(and SDRAM controller's) clock (100 MHz). For details see
the README files in the subdirectories.
