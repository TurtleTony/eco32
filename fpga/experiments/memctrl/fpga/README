Here are two implementations of a memory controller, intended
to be used on a real FPGA. The names of the subdirectories are
the same as the corresponding ones in ../sim. memctrl-0 does
not exist here, because the underlying RAM model cannot be
synthesized on the real FPGA. memctrl-1 is a memory controller
for SDRAM running at 100 MHz, where test circuit uses the same
clock rate. memctrl-2 is very similar to this, but runs the
test circuit at 50 MHz. For details see the README files in
the corresponding subdirectories of ../sim.
