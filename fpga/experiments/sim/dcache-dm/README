v0: fake cache
    every access is a hit (read and write)
    no errors until end of test

v1: basic cache read and write
    multiplexing read data from cache line to output
    demultiplexing write data from input to cache line
    pretend to get a cache hit with every access
    fails when reading loc 0x1160 for the first time
    (18900 ns, gen_state = 0x03, wrong data 0x60 instead of 0x00)

v2: basic cache read and write
    multiplexing read data from cache line to output
    demultiplexing write data from input to cache line
    hit detection, pipeline control, startup
    stalls when writing loc 0x1160 for the first time
    (900 ns, gen_state = 0x01, data = 0x00)
