The different parameters which influence the test pattern
generator are explored here.

1. In which gen_states is valid_out != 0 ?
   1a: state = 1
   1b: state = 1, 2, 3

2. What is the value of DISTANCE ?
   2a: DISTANCE = 6
   2b: DISTANCE = 1
   2c: DISTANCE = 0

3. What is the behavior of ready_in ?
   3a: ready_in = 1 always
   3b: ready_in = 0 starting directly after valid_out
   3c: ready_in = 0 starting asynchronously during valid_out
