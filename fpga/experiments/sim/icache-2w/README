v0: fake cache
    every access is a hit with correct data
    no errors until end of test

v1: basic cache read with preloaded cache memory
    hit detection for lines in a set, output multiplexer
    fails after 8 successful reads with wrong data

v2: basic cache read with preloaded cache memory
    hit detection for lines in a set, output multiplexer
    combined hit detection, pipeline control, startup
    stalls after 8 successful reads

v3: basic cache read with preloaded cache memory
    hit detection for lines in a set, output multiplexer
    combined hit detection, pipeline control, startup
    main memory read, cache line write (LRU replacement)
    cache memory re-read, pipeline restart
    runs out of predefined data after 32 successful reads

v4: cache reads without predefined cache contents
    hit detection for lines in a set, output multiplexer
    combined hit detection, pipeline control, startup
    main memory read, cache line write (LRU replacement)
    cache memory re-read, pipeline restart
    initialization of valid and LRU bits in all sets
    no errors until end of test
