Purpose
-------

This test circuit allows speed measurements of the old
memory controller (written by Dave Vanden Bout), driving
the on-board SDRAM of the XESS board. To do timing
measurements of reads or writes, wire the "we" signal
to 0 or 1, respectively. It is also possible to get a
mix of reads and writes if the "we" signal is a function
of (some bits of) the counter "count". Note that only
32-bit accesses are performed. The clock rate is 50 MHz.


Read
----

41.8 s
41.9 s
41.7 s

average:
41.8 s / 2^27 read cycles = 311.4 ns / read cycle
which means 15.6 clock cycles per read


Write
-----

19.6 s
19.7 s
19.6 s

average:
19.6 s / 2^27 write cycles = 146.0 ns / write cycle
which means 7.3 clock cycles per write


Mix (75% read, 25% write)
-------------------------

36.2 s
36.1 s
36.2 s

average:
36.2 s / 2^27 operations = 269.7 ns / operation
which means 13.5 clock cycles per operation


Conclusions
-----------

1) The weighted average from read and write operations
   (0.75*15.6 + 0.25*7.3) is a very good approximation
   for the value measured in the "mixed" case. This
   confirms the different values for the "read" and
   "write" cases.

2) The test circuit needs one clock cycle to recover
   from a read or write operation before the next one
   is started. The recommended number of clock cycles
   for a memory simulation are therefore
       read   : 14 clock cycles
       write  :  6 clock cycles
   measured from start of the operation (leading edge
   of signal stb) to end of the operation (trailing
   edge of signal ack).
