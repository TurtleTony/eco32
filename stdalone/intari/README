After starting the integer arithmetic server (either on
the simulator or on an FPGA), you must run the 'iatest'
client in another window of the host. Attach the client
to serial line 1 of the server. The client sends a series
of arithmetic tasks to the server, which responds with a
result for each task. The client logs both, the questions
and the answers.
